    <h3>If I were a boat, the type of boat that I would be is a sailboat.</h3>
    <p>I chose sailboat because it represents freedom, resilence, and the abilty to harness to nature to move forward. I move my life forward by the guide of the winds, but I can adjucst my path when I want to, this shows my purpose in my life. This also means that I value peace and freedom like the boats stay seady in the ocean even it is rough sometimes.</p>
